# password-generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to modify a website that would provide a user with a random password. The initial code was provided to me. From there, I enhanced the .js document so that the website would be more user-friendly. That included adding several prompts for user input on the live web page. The intial problem with the page was that, while the button clicked, nothing popped up on the web page. I added several function, variables, and "if" statements in order to create a more interactive site. I refreshed my memory regarding prompts, alerts, functions, and event listeners. I also learned about a new (to me) tool called "Not a Number."
